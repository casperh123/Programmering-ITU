## Complicating and simplifying factors

The developers in the group have worked together before, and cohesion, spirit, and commitment was high from the beginning. Our familiarity with each individual's work style and communication methods enabled effective collaboration from the beginning of the project.

The friendship between developers made the task of holding each other professionally accountable more difficult, but the sprint retrospectives greatly helped mitigate this.

The developers had been delegated the responsibility of managing the backlog, and this enabled us to make technically sound and architecturally coherent decisions throughout the project. However, this required us to allocate more time to ensure the backlog was consistently refined and prioritized according to the evolving needs of the project.

The group lacked experience with web scraping and python prior to the project. As a result of this, we used a substantial amount of time on research. We also had to make refactorings to our applications codebase, since our understanding of the used technologies and system architecture greatly increased during the project. To make the scraping even more difficult we quickly discorevered that university website are very different in layout, which required us to make a scraper module for each website. The fact that there are also a large amount of inconsistencies within each university's website further complicates the development of a scraper, since a scraper needs to be able to handle a large amount of edge cases and inconsistensies in where data is located.

All of the above combined with the unfamiliarity with SCRUM, made task estimation difficult. This resulted in many tasks being underestimated, and many group members experienced stress due to large amounts of work being pulled into the sprint backlog.
With time, Task estimation became more accurate, in part due to the increasing experience with the technology used, but mostly due to Task estimation being a recurring topic at the groups sprint retrospective, which resulted in action items focused on improving estimation.
