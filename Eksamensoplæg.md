## Demo: 

- Scrape programmes.
- Scrape Links.
- How does it scrape?
- Missing data.
- Scrape courses.

- Zealand og KU.
- Scheduling.
- API.
- Verification af data.

The application can use different methods to scrape. Right now we are scraping the IT university's website using a browser, just like a human would. Before, you saw it scraping all of the programmes, now it will find the links to course pages, and then it will gather information about individal coruses.

If data is missing from the page, it will log this to the console, such that a system administrator is notified about missing data and action can be taken.

Here you can see the scraper for the University of Copenhagen in Action.

Using the API you can get information about courses.

## Complicating and simplifying factors

The students have collaborated before and are friends outside of school. The familiarity with each others communication and work style, enabled effective collaboration from the beginning of the project.

This made holding each other professionally accountable more difficult, but the sprint retrospectives greatly helped mitigate this.

For parts of the project, the developers were responsible for backlog management. This enabled us to make technically sound and coherent decisions, but it required us to allocate more time to ensure the backlog was healthy and in accordance to the evolving needs of the project.

We lacked experience with web scraping and python prior to the project, and used a substantial amount of time on research. We also discovered that university websites are very different, and oftenh ave inconsistent structures, which our program needed to be able to handle. As such we had to make scrapers unique to the every website. 

All of the above combined with the unfamiliarity with SCRUM, made task estimation difficult. This resulted in many tasks being underestimated, and many group members experienced stress due to large amounts of work being pulled into the sprint backlog.
With time, Task estimation became more accurate, in part due to the increasing experience with the technology used, but mostly due to Task estimation being a recurring topic at the groups sprint retrospective, which resulted in action items focused on improving estimation.
