## Continuations

### Definition
- **Continuations** are an abstract representation of the control state of a program.
- A continuation represents "the rest of the computation" at any given point in a program.

### Continuation-Passing Style (CPS)
- **Continuation-Passing Style (CPS)** is a style of programming where functions take an extra argument: a continuation function.
- Instead of returning results, functions call the continuation function with the result.

### Benefits of CPS
- Makes control flow explicit and can simplify complex control structures like early exits, loops, and exceptions.
- Facilitates certain optimizations and transformations in compilers.

### Example

```fsharp
let rec factorial n cont =
    if n = 0 then cont 1
    else factorial (n - 1) (fun result -> cont (n * result))
factorial 5 id
```


## Tail Recursion
### Definition
- Tail Recursion occurs when the recursive call is the last operation in the function.
- Tail-recursive functions can be optimized by the compiler to reuse the current function's stack frame for
the recursive call, thus preventing stack overflow.

### Tail Recursion Optimization (TRO)

- Tail Call Optimization (TCO) or Tail Recursion Optimization (TRO) allows recursive functions to execute in constant stack space.
- This optimization is crucial for functional programming languages where recursion is a common control structure.

### Identifying Tail Recursion
- A function is tail-recursive if the recursive call is the final action in the function.
There must be no additional computation after the recursive call returns.

```fsharp
let rec factorial n acc =
    if n = 0 then acc
    else factorial (n - 1) (n * acc)

factorial 5 1
```

## Combining Continuations and Tail Recursion
### Tail Recursion with Continuations
Using continuations, you can transform non-tail-recursive functions into tail-recursive ones.
This involves passing an additional parameter that represents the continuation of the computation.

```fsharp
let rec factorial n cont =
    if n = 0 then cont 1
    else factorial (n - 1) (fun result -> cont (n * result))

factorial 5 id
```

## State Monads

### Definition
- **State Monad** is a design pattern used to handle stateful computations in a functional way.
- It allows functions to pass along a state without explicitly passing state parameters.
- A State Monad encapsulates a state and a computation that transforms the state and produces a value.

### Components of State Monad
1. **State**: Represents the current state.
2. **Computation**: Represents a function that takes a state and returns a value along with a new state.

### Basic Implementation in F#

```fsharp
// Define the State type
type State<'S, 'A> = State of ('S -> ('A * 'S))

// Function to run the stateful computation
let runState (State s) initialState = s initialState

// Function to return a value without changing the state
let returnState x = State (fun s -> (x, s))

// Function to bind stateful computations
let bindState m f = 
    State (fun s ->
        let (a, newState) = runState m s
        runState (f a) newState)
```
